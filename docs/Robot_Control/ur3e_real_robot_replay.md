# UR3e Real-Robot Replay Guide

This guide explains how to take the rollout actions exported from the Isaac Lab policy and replay them on a real UR3e using the Universal Robots ROS 2 driver.

The copied rollout file used by the replay tools is:

```text
data/ur3e_rollouts/2026-05-26_17-13-29_ppo_torch/exports/rollouts_10_episodes.json
```

The model/export metadata is:

```text
data/ur3e_rollouts/2026-05-26_17-13-29_ppo_torch/exports/policy_metadata.json
```

The ROS packages and replay exports are now contained in the `Dv-Rosws` workspace. The replay
tools resolve the default rollout from `$DV_ROSWS_ROOT/data/ur3e_rollouts/...`; they no longer
need an environment variable pointing to the old Isaac repository.

## Repo Tools

The consolidated ROS workspace now includes a ROS 2 Humble replay package:

```text
$DV_ROSWS_ROOT/src/ur3e_rollout_replay
```

It provides two commands:

```bash
ros2 run ur3e_rollout_replay ur3e_replay_validate
ros2 run ur3e_rollout_replay ur3e_replay_send
```

`ur3e_replay_validate` checks the rollout schema, joint order, raw timing, and retimed safety limits. The raw Isaac timestep is intentionally not used directly for physical replay; the command retimes the motion against conservative defaults.

`ur3e_replay_send` reads `/joint_states`, prepends a slow approach from the measured robot pose to the first rollout target, builds a `FollowJointTrajectory` goal, and only sends it when `--execute` is passed.

There is also a browser UI (`ros2 run ur3e_web_ui ur3e_web_ui`) with a live 3D model, jog control, TCP pose readout, and a rollout tab that validates, previews (ghost animation, no robot motion), and executes the same episodes. See `docs/Robot_Control/ur3e_web_ui.md`.

For the architecture of the complete robot-control stack, see `docs/Robot_Control/ur3e_robot_control_architecture.md`.

For the current ROS 2 Humble driver setup and Ethernet fix, see:

```text
docs/Robot_Control/ur3e_current_driver_setup.md
```

The previous legacy-source-driver path is kept in `docs/Robot_Control/ur3e_legacy_driver_setup.md` only for reference. The recommended path now uses the current `ros-humble-ur` binary packages.

First build and test against mock hardware before connecting the real arm.

## What the Actions Mean

Each rollout sample contains both the commanded target and the realized state:

- `action_normalized`: raw policy output from the SKRL agent.
- `joint_position_target_rad`: the position **command** sent to the Isaac Lab articulation. In legacy
  rollouts this was `action_normalized * action_scale`; in new sim-to-real rollouts it is the
  post-clamp incremental target after `v_safe`/`a_safe` limiting.
- `joint_position_before_rad`: the joint positions the robot **actually reached** in the simulation at that control step.

### Replay the realized motion, not the raw command

For the legacy export currently copied in `data/ur3e_rollouts/...`,
`joint_position_target_rad` is the *commanded* PD-drive target, not the motion the robot performed.
That old policy commands extremely aggressive targets — the per-step command implies **65–170 rad/s**,
far beyond anything the arm can follow in one 1/60 s control step. The simulated robot only reaches
**~6 rad/s** (`joint_position_before_rad`), because the joint PD drive heavily filters those
targets. So:

- What you **see in Isaac Sim** is `joint_position_before_rad` (smooth, modest motion).
- Replaying `joint_position_target_rad` reproduces the raw command instead: at raw timing it is wildly fast, and even after safety retiming the real robot has time to actually *reach* the extreme targets, tracing a much larger path than the simulated robot ever did.

Therefore the replay defaults to the **realized** source (`joint_position_before_rad`) for legacy
rollouts. Use `target` (`joint_position_target_rad`) only for diagnostics/comparison unless the file
metadata says the rollout was regenerated with the new incremental, rate-limited action semantics.
The replay tools expose this as `--source {realized,target}` (CLI) and the `source` query/body field
(web API); the web UI has a `realized`/`target` toggle and a Compare view that overlays the two. Do
not stream `action_normalized` directly to the UR3e.

In this task:

```text
legacy: joint_position_target_rad = action_normalized * 0.5
new:    joint_position_target_rad = q + clamp(action, -1, 1) * v_safe * dt_s, then a_safe/limit clamped
joint_position_before_rad = realized sim motion
dt_s = 0.016666666666666666  # = sim.dt (1/120) * decimation (2) = 1/60
```

The 6 joint targets are absolute joint positions in radians, ordered as:

```text
shoulder_pan_joint
shoulder_lift_joint
elbow_joint
wrist_1_joint
wrist_2_joint
wrist_3_joint
```

These are not velocity commands, torque commands, or Cartesian TCP commands.

## Recommended ROS 2 Replay Path

Use the Universal Robots ROS 2 driver and the default `scaled_joint_trajectory_controller`. The controller accepts joint trajectories and applies UR speed scaling, so it is the first path to use before any lower-level streaming approach.

Official references:

- Universal Robots ROS 2 driver overview: https://docs.universal-robots.com/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Documentation/
- UR ROS 2 controllers: https://docs.universal-robots.com/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Documentation/doc/ur_robot_driver/ur_robot_driver/doc/usage/controllers.html

High-level flow:

1. Start with fake hardware or URSim.
2. Load `rollouts_10_episodes.json`.
3. Select one episode.
4. Read each sample's `joint_position_before_rad` by default.
5. Build a `trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory`.
6. Send it through `control_msgs/action/FollowJointTrajectory` to:

```text
/scaled_joint_trajectory_controller/follow_joint_trajectory
```

7. Only after simulation validation, run on the physical UR3e in reduced speed mode with no ball and an operator at the E-stop.

## Robot Setup Checklist

Before commanding the real robot:

- Install and configure the Universal Robots ROS 2 driver for `ur3e`.
- Install the External Control URCap on the robot if your driver setup requires it.
- Confirm the robot calibration used by the ROS 2 driver matches the physical arm.
- Set the correct TCP and payload for the hoop/end-effector.
- Remove the ball and any unnecessary obstacles for the first tests.
- Use reduced mode or a low teach-pendant speed slider.
- Keep an operator at the E-stop.
- Verify the workspace is clear for the full planned motion.
- Confirm the robot starts near the first rollout target before replay.

## Start the Driver

Use the exact launch options for your ROS 2 distribution and driver version. A typical real-robot launch looks like:

```bash
ros2 launch ur_robot_driver ur_control.launch.py \
  ur_type:=ur3e \
  robot_ip:=<ROBOT_IP> \
  launch_rviz:=true
```

For dry runs, use fake hardware or URSim first. Depending on your installed driver version, fake hardware is typically launched with an option like:

```bash
ros2 launch ur_robot_driver ur_control.launch.py \
  ur_type:=ur3e \
  robot_ip:=<ROBOT_IP_OR_DUMMY_IP> \
  use_fake_hardware:=true \
  launch_rviz:=true
```

Check that the scaled trajectory controller is available:

```bash
ros2 control list_controllers
```

The active motion controller should include:

```text
scaled_joint_trajectory_controller
```

## Convert a Rollout to a Joint Trajectory

A replay program should create a `FollowJointTrajectory.Goal` with:

- `trajectory.joint_names`: the six UR3e joint names listed above.
- `trajectory.points[i].positions`: `samples[i]["joint_position_before_rad"]` (the realized motion; see "What the Actions Mean").
- `trajectory.points[i].time_from_start`: cumulative time from the rollout, using `metadata["dt_s"]`.

Do not immediately start the policy motion from an arbitrary real robot pose. First prepend a slow approach segment from the current measured joint state to the first rollout target.

Recommended first-pass timing:

- Approach duration: 5 to 10 seconds.
- Replay timing: do not use the raw rollout `dt_s` directly on hardware.
- First physical test: use the replay node's conservative retiming defaults.

Minimal replay logic:

```python
import json

JOINT_NAMES = [
    "shoulder_pan_joint",
    "shoulder_lift_joint",
    "elbow_joint",
    "wrist_1_joint",
    "wrist_2_joint",
    "wrist_3_joint",
]

with open("data/ur3e_rollouts/2026-05-26_17-13-29_ppo_torch/exports/rollouts_10_episodes.json") as file:
    rollout = json.load(file)

dt = rollout["metadata"]["dt_s"]
episode = rollout["episodes"][0]
# Realized motion the robot reached in sim (faithful replay). Use
# "joint_position_target_rad" only for the raw command (diagnostics).
positions = [sample["joint_position_before_rad"] for sample in episode["samples"]]
```

The full ROS 2 node should then send those positions as a `control_msgs/action/FollowJointTrajectory` goal to `/scaled_joint_trajectory_controller/follow_joint_trajectory`.

## Safety Validation Before Real Motion

Run these checks before sending any trajectory to the physical arm:

- Joint limits: every position is inside the UR3e joint limits.
- Step size: adjacent joint targets are small enough for the replay timing.
- Velocity: estimated joint velocity between samples is acceptable.
- Acceleration: estimated acceleration is not aggressive.
- Start pose: current robot joints are close to the planned approach start.
- Collision clearance: the hoop, wrist, arm, table, and nearby objects are clear.
- End behavior: the robot has a controlled final hold or slow stop.

For this exported rollout, the 10 saved episodes contain short successful snippets, roughly 10 to 16 policy steps each. That means the real motion segment is short; most real-robot risk will come from the approach to the first target and from sim-to-real mismatch.

## Why Live Policy Control Is Different

The saved rollout is replay-only. Running the policy live on the UR3e is a separate project because the policy observation includes simulated values:

- current joint position
- current joint velocity
- disk position
- ball position
- ball-to-disk direction
- ball distance
- ball velocity
- previous signed disk crossing state
- previous action
- pass-through count

On the real robot, the joint state can come from ROS 2, but the ball and disk state require calibrated perception and frame transforms. Do not assume the exported ONNX or TorchScript policy can be connected directly to the robot without reconstructing the exact 33-D observation.

The full closed-loop deployment plan — including the simulation, training, and inference constraints needed because the real UR3e is slower than Isaac Sim — is in `docs/Robot_Control/ur3e_ball_catch_sim_to_real.md`.

## Advanced Alternative: RTDE and `servoj`

RTDE and URScript `servoj` can be used later for lower-level joint servoing, but this is timing-sensitive and easier to destabilize. UR documents RTDE as a real-time data exchange interface, and `servoj` as online joint-position control.

Official references:

- UR RTDE guide: https://docs.universal-robots.com/tutorials/communication-protocol-tutorials/rtde-guide.html
- UR `servoj` command: https://www.universal-robots.com/articles/ur/programming/servoj-command/

If you later use this route, stream `joint_position_before_rad` (the realized motion) as the joint position target `q`, not `action_normalized` or the raw `joint_position_target_rad`, and start with conservative `lookahead_time`, gain, and reduced speed settings.
